Vision for APP
The goal was to build an app that allowed users/ tourists to pinpoint where and what public murals were along the beltline trail. A user would have access to an interactive map that held clickable and hoverable icons of each artist in the exact position on the trail of where the mural or work of art existed. A user would have the option of submitting updated information in case a new artist and mural existed.

Future Goals

My plan for this app in the future will be to somehow figure out how to access external links within React. This seems to be an ongoing issue with programmers and I am not confident enough in my React coding to solve this. I want users to be able to access clickable links for each artist upon pinpoints on the map. I also would like to add more than one image at a time on the page. 

I also plan to restyle the page for a higher def and more dynamic appearance. I want users to want to use the app due to ease and function. I would also add a user login function for privacy and safety to the app.
